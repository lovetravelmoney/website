Robert's parents took us on a trip to his mother's favorite city in all of Ireland, [Kinsale](https://www.kinsale.ie/). We had visited it before when we explored [Charles Fort](https://lovetravelmoney.com/exploring-charles-fort-in-kinsale-ireland/), but this time we continued on slightly past the colorful quirky town and drove towards the tip of the headland and gazed upon the wondrous landscape of the famous Old Head.

Old Head now is a world-class member's only golf course that has been graced by celebrities and politicians worldwide. Ireland took its name from the Eirinn clan who moved from Western Europe before 1000 B.C. Their fortified community on the Old Head was described as DÃºn Cearmna.

Flash forward to 1169, the first Norman invasion led to the de Courcey family taking control of the headland. There they built a castle, part of which you can still visit today. The tower and wall ruins now are used as a stately entrance guarding the rest of the members-only golf course area.

Fun fact! The Old Head is one of the few landmarks in Northern Europe shown on a map by the Greek historian, [Ptolemy](), in 100 A.D.

This landscape is stunning with staggering cliffs, rolling green hills and a rugged, natural that is a breathtaking must-see stop part of the [Wild Atlantic Way](https://www.wildatlanticway.com/home).
