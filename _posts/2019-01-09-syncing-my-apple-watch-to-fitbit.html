<p>Hey ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p>
As you know working out and getting your steps it is important for both your physical and mental health.
</p>

<p>
I gave Courtney a Fitbit for Christmas so we both could challenge each other to get our steps in each day and keep us motivated and not lazy. On Christmas, a family member threw out my Fitbit charger. I do have an Apple watch and thought how it was a shame I couldn't sync my steps from the Apple watch to the Fitbit app and challenge her. I did find a way.

<h3>
How do I sync my Apple Watch to Fitbit?
</h3>

<p>
To get started, download the Fitbit app from the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, or Microsoft Store, and tap Join Fitbit. When asked which tracker you're setting up, choose "No Fitbit Yet?" and follow the MobileTrack instructions.
</p>
<p>
If you already have a Fitbit account, log into the app and tap or click the Account icon (User-added image). Choose the option for setting up a new device and follow the MobileTrack instructions.

<h3>So how does this work?</h3>
<p>
Well, your Fitbit will now sync from your Health app in your iPhone along with using the sensors. So your apple watch will sync to your Health app and that will sync to your Fitbit.</p>
<p>
Its simple really and this means I can kick Courtneys but in our daily steps challenge. Do you guys play games when you travel? Did this help? Let me know in the comments below.
