So follow in our footsteps and check out this easy and cheap 1 Day in Dublin Walking Tour Itinerary. We had the bonus of exploring just after Christmas and the city was decked out in charming holiday cheer, but this tour would work for any time of the year.

First we travelled by train from Cork to Dublin and started our walking adventure from [Heuston Station](https://goo.gl/maps/EtNUSovHWip).

From there we walked along the [River Liffey](https://www.britannica.com/place/River-Liffey) taking in the beautiful views along the waterway and headed to [St. Stephen's Green Shopping center](https://www.stephensgreen.com/). There we had the most FANTASTIC hot chocolate at [Butler's](https://www.butlerschocolates.com/en). There are several Butler's locations around Ireland and I would urge you to stop and taste this cocoa delight if you find yourself passing by one.

St. Stephen's Green Shopping Mall is an architectural gem of an area to shop and stroll around and it was especially beautiful decorated for Christmas.

Across the way we took a jaunt to [St. Stephen's Green](http://www.heritageireland.ie/en/dublin/ststephensgreen/), Ireland's best known Victorian public park. It's quite common to see people feeding pigeons and strolling around it's ornamental lake in this 22 acre green oasis.

After this we headed to the world famous, [Trinity College](https://www.tcd.ie/) and walked around the impressive 47-acre campus with stately, Georgian buildings. After exploring a toured the [Book of Kells](https://www.tcd.ie/visitors/book-of-kells/) exhibit at the college. This was incredibly impressive and very memorable part of the whole trip. If you do 1 thing in Dublin, this MUST be it.

The Book of Kells is Ireland's greatest cultural treasure and the world's most famous medieval manuscript. The 9th century book is a richly decorated copy of the four Gospels of the life of Jesus Christ.

The exhibition is open 7 days a week. Tickets can be purchased online here. Tickets also give you access to the magnificent [Old Library](https://www.tcd.ie/library/old-library/) building built in the 18th century. Walking around in here makes you feel like you've been transported to Hogwarts, it's incredible!

After this we headed to the famed [Temple Bar](https://www.10best.com/destinations/ireland/dublin/templebar-and-environs/) street and walked around to see the sights. It's a bustling stretch of road with concert venues, bars and restaurants. If you're wanting to have dinner and drinks in Dublin, head to Temple Bar and trust me, you'll be able to find something you'll like. We decided we were in the mood for burgers and dined at [Gourmet Burger Factory](https://www.gbk.ie/location/3?address&utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=google_LPM_Temple_Bar), and it did not disappoint.

Next, we cross the [Ha'penny Bridge](http://www.bridgesofdublin.ie/bridges/hapenny-bridge/history). The pedestrian bridge was constructed in 1816, but during the restoration 85% of the original railwork was retained. It's an amazing site.

Across the river we headed to the historically, important GPO, or [General Post Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Post_Office,_Dublin). Sited in the centre of O'Connell Street, it is one of Ireland's most famous buildings. The building has remained a symbol of Irish freedom since the Easter Rising of 1916 where the GPO served as the headquarters. The bullet holes that hit the columns are still preserved to this day.

Almost directly across from the GPO is another Irish symbol, but one that had a mixed reaction when it was unveiled. The Spire, it a towering monument that stands 120 meters tall. I think it's kinda cool, especially when we saw it at dusk as it was lit up, but some people feel it's a bit of an eyesore with no real cultural connection to the city.

At this point is started lashing rain and we decided to find our way back to the train station and back to Cork.

All in all it was a fun and memorable day in Dublin. Hope to go back someday to cross a few more important sites off the Dublin bucket list!
