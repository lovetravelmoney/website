When visiting the South of Ireland it's a travesty not to go to the [Blarney Castle](https://www.blarneycastle.ie/). The castle was built nearly six hundred years ago and has been attracted the attention of millions have as travelers venture to the picturesque village of Blarney, often just for the castle and to kiss the Blarney Stone. It's a must-see iconic landmark and one of the Emerald Isle's greatest treasures.

Now the legendary "Stone of Eloquence", The Blarney Stone, is found at the top of the castle tower. While we were there, we had to climb to the top and kiss the stone. Now, I've been blessed with the gift of the gab, and haven't shut up since!

There are those who think that you come to Blarney Castle only to see the Stone, but you'd be missing out on the beautiful and expansive 60 acres of sprawling parklands which include gardens, lakes, dungeons, wildlife and miles of walkways, and waterways.

There's also the equally impressive [Blarney House](), which is a Scottish Baronial mansion that is open to the public in the summer months.
