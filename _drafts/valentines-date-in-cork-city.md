Since our relationship has been back and forth and so much of it long distance, last year we weren't together for Valentines Day, but this year we were and decided to make the most of it! So follow along on our cute and fun valentines date in beautiful Cork City, Ireland. We started at [Cork Coffee Roasters](https://corkcoffeeroasters.ie/) for a delish caffeine boost. Btw this is our fav coffee spot in Cork. I recommend the Mocha! 😍

Then we headed just around the corner to[ Uncle Pete’s](https://www.unclepetes.ie/) for some pizza and rhubarb pie. 🍕🥧 Uncle Pete’s happens to be in the same building Rob’s parents went on their first date, so it was an especially special spot to go there for our date.

After that, we headed to [Tabletop](), a fantastic little spot where board game geeks can play to their heart's content. The two of us being said board game geeks, spent a couple of hours trying out some new games we had never played and stirring up some friendly competition before heading home.

Rob surprised me with flowers 2 days in a row and some Cadbury. Overall, the absolute most perfect, fun Valentines adventure day in Cork!
