### Meet Robert James & Courtney


Hi! Thanks for stopping by! We’re a couple of travel addicts, conquering and discovering the world one short trip at a time, while working a full-time job.
 

We guess you ended up on our blog because, like us, you love to travel. We like to spend our free time in places around the world like the Ireland, Austin and Greece, to name a few! Many people quit their jobs in order to travel the world. We’re a little too ambitious to give it all up, though. So we decided to try and travel the world while also working full time back home in USA. We don’t have the luxury to travel indefinitely but we don’t let that stop us from living our dream.

Sounds familiar?

Then, follow along on our short adventures as we conquer the planet!
